== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Tip: The author link ideally should go to the authors web page but your guest author posts will show up as one of your posts. You can get around the list problem by creating a new user called Guest Authors. Create your guest author posts under this user or use an author switch plugin to change the registered author. That way, guest author posts will show up under the user "Guest Authors" instead of your account.
